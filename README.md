# Advanced-Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various advanced algorithms in C++ as part of the Advanced Algorithm Lab. The goal is to provide clear and efficient implementations of these algorithms and gain a deeper understanding of their working principles.


## Overview

The algorithms are organized into different folders based on their category.

#### Folder 1 (Basic)
- Insertion in Linked List  
- Insertion Sort  
- Alternate Digit Sum  
- Merge Three Sorted Arrays  
- Merge Sort  

#### Folder 2 (Dynamic Programming)
- Binary Search Tree (BST)  
- 0/1 Knapsack  
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)  
- Matrix Chain Multiplication  
- Rod Cutting Problem  
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)  
- Weighted Job Scheduling  

#### Folder 3 (Greedy Approach)
- Bin Packing Problem  
- Fractional Knapsack  
- Huffman Coding  

#### Folder 4 (Branch and Bound)
- 0/1 Knapsack (Branch and Bound)  
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) (Branch and Bound)  

#### Folder 5 (Backtracking)
- 0/1 Knapsack (Backtracking)  
- N-Queens Problem
